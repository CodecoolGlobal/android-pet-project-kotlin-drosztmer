# Android Pet Project

## Story

Now that you're familiar with so many libraries and SDK components within the wondrous world of Android development, it's time to shine and create an app based on your own ideas. This freestyle project will give you the chance to practice topics that you don't feel confident about. Try to move out of your comfort zone to make a good progress this week!

## What are you going to learn?

- using `Kotlin` language
- practice an Architecture Pattern of your choice
- using Dependency Injection
- using Canvas

## Tasks

1. Create a freestyle app of any kind
    - The project has no Java files, every class is written in Kotlin
    - The project has a sprint plan reviewed by a mentor before the implementation starts
    - The project is using an architecture pattern
    - The project is using the `RxJava` library
    - The project uses dependency injection
    - The project uses `View Binding`, because `ButterKnife` recently has become deprecated
    - The project uses `Canvas`

## General requirements

- All colors, dimens and string resources in the project are extracted into their respective `xml` files.

## Hints

- Popular dependency injection libraries for Kotlin : `Koin` and `Kodein`
- Have fun, create an app that is motivating for you! :)
- How to figure out what kind of app and features to implement? 
- Here are some ideas:
    - have a brainstorming session, write your ideas down somewhere
    - collect all the feature ideas you want to include and specify the expectations (these are your user stories in your backlog)
    - create design plans for your screens, or at least a wireframe 
    - now estimate each user story and figure out how many you can finish in this sprint
- Don't forget to use git branches as you develop new features and assign MR-s to your mentor for review
